      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>My name is Ray O'Neill, a developer that values performance, streamlined experiences, and a well-written codebase. I've worked professionally as a backend PL/SQL developer and have been learning full-stack web development on the side since the Fall of 2023.</p>

      <h2>Professional Work</h2>
      <p>My portfolio is comprised of projects assigned through the web development education course, The Odin Project (<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">it's free!</a>).</p>
      <p>From the basics to Node and Express, I've been following and learning as much as I can, with the hopes of landing a professional role in the future.</p>
      <p>While React was taught, and some projects use React in my portfolio, this iteration of my portfolio site does not use it.</p>
      <ul class="project-cards">
        <li class="card-item">

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/cs-cmd/memory-game">Pokemon-themed memory game</a></h3>
          <p>A memory game using the free PokeAPI; usable without signup, so it's easy to utilize.</p>
          <p>This project, for me, was fairly straight-forward to implement with the use of React.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card-item">
          <img class="preview-image" alt="cv-creator-preview" src="./src/images/odin-cv-screenshot.png"/>
          <h3><a href="https://github.com/cs-cmd/odin-cv">Resume Creator</a></h3>
          <p>Built using React.</p>
          <p>A resume creator built with React. My first foray into the React world, so the features are slim.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="card-item">
          <img alt="battleship-preview-image" class="preview-image" src="./src/images/battleship-screenshot.png"/>
          <h3><a href="https://github.com/cs-cmd/battleship">Battleship</a></h3>
          <p>Built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, this project simulates the classic game, Battleship.</p>
          <p>A feature I'm most proud of in this project is the ship placement preview.</p>          
        </li>
        <li class="card-item">
          <img alt="city-cube-restaurant-preview" class="preview-image" src="./src/images/citycube-ss.png"/>
          <h3><a href="https://github.com/cs-cmd/city-cube-restaurant">CityCube Restaurant</a></h3>
          <p>A fictional chain restaurant set in an dystopian future.</p>
          <p>An interesting feature I chose to implement is the caching of the web page tabs; it's not too feasible, in my opinion, for larger projects, but it was a journey into experimenting for me.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/cs-cmd/OnyxRidgeCM">OnyxRidgeCM</a></h3>
          <p>My undergradute capstone project, this android application was meant to imitate a project management application for construction companies.</p>
          <p>This was my first foray into using third-party libraries to help with project development (in this case, it was to make PDF reports based on user input).</p>
